# Sentiment classification using PyTorch library torchtext

I tried to explore the torchtext library. Used kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis.
I only focussed here to explore different thing, not on accuracy. For that I did not used full dataset and not performed the raw text processing here.

I faced difficulty to understand when I saw someone's code on GitHub or anywhere in my initial days. 
So I thought, I will also upload the "rough experiment" file along with my code.
