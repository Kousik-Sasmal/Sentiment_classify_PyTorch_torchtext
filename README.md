# Sentiment classification using PyTorch library `torchtext`

I tried to explore the torchtext library using kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis.

I only focussed here to explore the different things, not on accuracy. For that I did not used full dataset and not performed the raw text processing here.

Main code is written in `main.py` and data processing code is written in `data_process.py`.

I also added the `rough_experiment.ipynb` notebook file along with my code.  

I have made a `sentiment model` using PyTorch with `modular coding approach`, link is https://github.com/Kousik-Sasmal/tweeter-sentiment-using-pytorch/tree/main.
